# Mysql-classes-work
In this class, we learned how to use MySQL for managing databases. We practiced creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting data. We also used SELECT queries, JOINs, and filters to retrieve specific information. The class gave us hands-on experience with SQL commands and database operations.
